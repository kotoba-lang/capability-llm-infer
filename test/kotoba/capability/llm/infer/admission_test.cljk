  "Every refusal, with its reason pinned.

  This capability's content is which requests it declines, so a test that
  asserted only `(not allowed?)` would count a refusal for ANY cause as the one
  it meant to exercise — ADR-2608136000 §6. Each assertion below names the
  reason, so a change that starts refusing for a different cause fails here."

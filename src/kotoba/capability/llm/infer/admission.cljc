(ns kotoba.capability.llm.infer.admission
  "Whether one inference request may be sent, as a pure decision.

  `llm/infer` declares three effects where `http/fetch` declares one:

      http/fetch   #{:network-read}
      llm/infer    #{:data-egress :network-write :llm-inference}

  Each of the three is a separate thing the policy has to decide, and the
  reason this namespace is longer than `egress.cljc` is that it decides three
  questions rather than one:

  | effect | the question | the bound |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:network-write` | may this endpoint be reached at all | `:allow-endpoints` |
  | `:data-egress` | how much may leave this machine | `:max-prompt-bytes` |
  | `:llm-inference` | how much work may be bought | `:max-output-tokens` |

  Pure and `.cljc` on purpose. Every refusal below is reachable in a test with
  no socket, which is the only way a negative test can be trusted to have been
  exercised for the reason it claims (ADR-2608136000 §6).

  ## The alias trap: resolve first, then admit

  The workspace's model SSoT is an alias (`murakumo-main`) that resolves to an
  endpoint, and the endpoint moves. So a policy written about the ALIAS decides
  about a name while the request goes to whatever that name resolves to today —
  the decision made about one thing and executed against another. That is the
  same shape as following an HTTP redirect after the allowlist has already
  said yes, which `capability-http-fetch` refuses to do for the same reason.

  `admit` therefore takes `:endpoint`, not an alias, and refuses with
  `:infer/endpoint-unresolved` when it is absent. **Resolving the alias is a
  network READ and belongs to `http/fetch` — a different definition CID and
  therefore a different grant.** This capability does not resolve anything, and
  a provider here that quietly did would be exercising an authority it was
  never given.

  ## Deny by default here, and REPORT-when-absent in `bot-bounds`

  Two rows in this workspace look alike and default in opposite directions, so
  the difference is worth stating rather than discovering:

  - `cloud.itonami.app.bot-bounds` is **enforced when set, reported when
    absent**. It caps work that is already authorised and already paid for
    under the operator's own key; defaulting it to zero would stop live bots
    on nobody's decision.
  - this namespace is **deny by default**. It is not a cap on authorised work,
    it IS the authorisation — `:capability/default-policy :approval-required`.
    An absent ceiling here is not a permissive ceiling, it is a grant nobody
    bounded.

  Copying the wrong default between them is easy and silent, which is why both
  docstrings name the other.

  ## Eight refusals, eight facts

  | reason | what happened | what the operator changes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:infer/no-policy` | an allowlist is empty | write the policy |
  | `:infer/unbounded` | allowlists exist, a ceiling does not | write the ceiling |
  | `:infer/endpoint-unresolved` | nobody said where this model is served | resolve it (via `http/fetch`) |
  | `:infer/unparsable-endpoint` | an endpoint was given and cannot be read | fix the endpoint |
  | `:infer/scheme-not-allowed` | not https | fix the endpoint |
  | `:infer/endpoint-not-allowed` | a policy exists and this host is not in it | widen the policy, deliberately |
  | `:infer/model-not-allowed` | a policy exists and this model is not in it | widen the policy, deliberately |
  | `:infer/prompt-too-large` | more would leave the machine than permitted | shrink the prompt, or the ceiling |

  Collapsing them into `denied` would leave the caller with one word for eight
  situations that are fixed by editing eight different things."

(defn admit
  "`{:allowed? true …}` or a refusal naming its reason.

  `request` is `{:model \"…\" :endpoint \"https://…\" :prompt-bytes n
  :max-output-tokens n}`. `:endpoint` is the RESOLVED endpoint — see the alias
  trap above; an alias passed here is refused as unparsable rather than
  resolved.

  A caller asking for more output than the policy permits is **narrowed, not
  refused**: the result carries the capped `:max-output-tokens` and
  `:narrowed? true`. That mirrors `bot-bounds/cap` — every ceiling narrows and
  none raises — and it keeps the fact visible instead of silently granting the
  smaller number as if it had been asked for.

  A prompt over `:max-prompt-bytes` is refused rather than truncated. Truncating
  it would send a DIFFERENT prompt than the caller wrote while reporting
  success, and `:data-egress` is precisely the effect where quietly changing
  what left the machine is the wrong answer."

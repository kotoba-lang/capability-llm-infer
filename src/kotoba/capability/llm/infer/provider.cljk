(ns kotoba.capability.llm.infer.provider
  "JVM reference host provider for actor:host field \"llm_infer\".

  The core in `artifacts/provider.core.wasm` returns -3 from every call. This
  namespace is what an embedder binds over it.

  ## Three things the guest cannot pass

  `provider` closes over all three. The guest hands in a model name and a
  prompt, and nothing else:

  | | why it is in the closure |
  |---|---|
  | the **policy** | a guest that could pass one could widen its own authority |
  | the **endpoint** | a guest that could pass one could send its prompt anywhere |
  | the **credential** | a guest that could read one could spend it elsewhere |

  The third is specific to this capability. `http/fetch` reads public URLs;
  `llm/infer` writes to a metered endpoint under someone's key, and
  `:capability/effects` says `:data-egress` — the prompt leaves the machine.
  If the key travelled through the ABI it would be in guest memory, and the
  capability would be handing out the very thing it exists to hold.

  ## Resolution happens before admission, never after

  `:resolve-endpoint` is a host function from model name to URL. It is called
  FIRST, and `admission/admit` decides about what it returned. Admitting the
  alias and then resolving it would be deciding about one thing and acting on
  another — the redirect hazard, in a different coat.

  There is no default resolver, and that is deliberate. The workspace SSoT is
  the `murakumo-main` alias (CLAUDE.md), but baking that host here would (a)
  make a network read from inside a capability that was granted a network
  write, and (b) freeze a value CLAUDE.md says repeatedly not to freeze. With
  no resolver and no explicit endpoint, every call refuses with
  `:infer/endpoint-unresolved` — one fact, one message, nothing attempted.

  ## The wire shape is not this package's to guess

  `:request-body-fn` is required. An inference request's JSON differs per
  vendor, and a default would freeze one into an authority package; writing
  that JSON by hand here would put string escaping in the one file whose whole
  job is care about what leaves the machine. Its absence refuses with
  `:infer/no-request-encoder` — the ninth fact, and the only one this namespace
  adds to `admission`'s eight.

  ## Return codes are the contract

     >= 0  bytes written
     -1    refused by policy       (a decision was made; see the receipt)
     -2    transport failed        (a request went out and did not come back)
     -3    no host provider bound  (nothing was attempted)

  -1 and -2 must not collapse. `bin/itonami` keeps the same two apart in its
  exit codes and says why: \"'The server said no' is a measurement; 'nothing was
  listening' is not, and an operator sent to read a refusal that never happened
  debugs the wrong thing\" (ADR-2608136000)."
